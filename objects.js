// Activity:

// In the below exercises, write code that achieves
// the desired result. To check your work, run this
// file in your Terminal.

var foods = {
  apples: 23, 
  grapes: 507, 
  eggs: 48
};

// Write code that prints all of the 'keys' of the foods variable 
// you created above:
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(Object.keys(foods));

// Write code that prints all of the 'values' of the foods variable 
// you created above:
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(Object.values(foods));

// Write code that prints the value of the second food of the foods variable 
// you created above:
// // YOUR CODE HERE

var keys = Object.keys(foods);
console.log(keys);

var secondFood = keys[1];
console.log(secondFood);

// Write code that adds a food to the foods object. 
// Then, print the updated object:
// YOUR CODE HERE

foods.strawberries = 3;
console.log(foods);


// -------------------
// Part 2: Email
// -------------------


// Think about all the pieces of information associated with one single email in your inbox.
// It has a sender, a subject, ...

// Declare a variable that stores an object. Each key should be an attribute of an email and each
// value should be some appropriate value for that key. Work to have at least 5 key-value pairs.

var email = {
  sender: "Louis Kitty",
  subject: "I am hungry",
  message: "What time is dinner? Can I have some snacky treats in the meantime?",
  recipient: "Sara Connelly",
  year: 2023,
};

// Write code that logs your email object to the terminal.
console.log(email);

// Write code that logs all of the 'keys' of the email object 
// you created above:
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(Object.keys(email));

// Write code that logs all of the 'values' of the email object 
// you created above:
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(Object.values(email));

// Part 3: Many Emails - CHALLENGE!
// -------------------

// LONG EXAMPLE:
// Now that we've learned about Objects AND Arrays, we can combine them.

// Check out the following example of an array of Instagram posts:


var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];


// // An Array of Objects is probably more realistic. Objects are a data type that's great
// // for storing more complex data. Below, we can store multiple key-value pairs
// // that relate to each individual Instagram post:


posts = [
  {
    imageSrc: "./images/beach.png",
    caption: "At the beach with my besties",
    timestamp: "4:37 PM August 13, 2019",
    number_likes: 0,
    comments: []
  }, 
  {
    imageSrc: "./images/holiday-party.png",
    caption: "What a great holiday party omg",
    timestamp: "11:37 PM December 31, 2019",
    number_likes: 13,
    comments: []
  }
];

console.log(posts);
console.log(posts[0]);


// // The code snippet above shows an Array with 2 elements. Each element in the Array is a 
// // Objects. Each of those Objects has 4 key-value pairs. This may LOOK 
// // a bit daunting - it's OK! You don't need to be 100% comfortable with this, but it's
// // good to have some exposure before going into Mod 1.


// // YOU DO: Create an array of at least 3 EMAIL Objects, using the same 
// // key-value pairs you used in your email Object above.
// // Then, print the email Array to the Terminal.

emails = [
  {
    subject: "Rent due",
