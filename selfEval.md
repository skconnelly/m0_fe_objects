# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

I've felt really defeated these past two days, and am worried about my success throughout Turing's FE program. I know that independent learning and research is an essential part of software development, but right now, it feels impossible. I learn much better with people and an instructor accessible; hence why I'm enrolled in a program for FE development as opposed to self-learning. 

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

When I am in a groove, my workflow goes well. It is really hard for me to figure out how to navigate through unproductive struggle. I was stuck on some issues for about 1.5 hours, reached out in Slack and to my instructor, and understandably, didn't get any immediate feedback; this felt incredibly defeating, rather than feeling like something I could overcome. I know that I need to work on a mental shift if I am going to get through this program. 

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?

There is going to be a lot more independent struggle than what I initially thought, and this feels really uncomfortable. I need to work on my mindset in order to complete a program like this.
